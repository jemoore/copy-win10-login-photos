# copy-win10-login-photos

I found that I really like the Windows 10 logon screen wallpaper and wanted to use the photos as my desktop background.

This python script will copy the Windows 10 photos used as wallpaper on the login screen to a specified directory.
You can then use this directory as the location of your desktop wallpaper.

You will need to modify the WALLPAPER_DIR variable to a valid directory location.
